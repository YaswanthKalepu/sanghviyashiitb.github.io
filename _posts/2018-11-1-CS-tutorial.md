Here are lecture slides for my recent introductory tutorial on Compressive Sesning presented as a part of the graduate course <a class = "link" href = 'http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2018b-EE5120/index.html'>EE5120 Linear Algebra</a> (03 Oct). The lecture was aimed to provide a bridge in linear algebra concepts the students had learned in the class and how they can be applied to real world application. Since the underlying ideas of CS are so simple and its use cases so perverse, it seemed to be a good idea to introduce them to students in the middle of the course.

Here are the sources which were used to make the slides:
* <a class = "link" href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472240'>Introduction to Compressive Sensing</a>: An article written by Candes and Walking and appeared in IEEE Journals and Magazine. The language of the article is very simple and covers a lot of the material I talked about in the class. 
* <a class = "link" href = 'http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/courses/2010_2/papers/csCamera-SPMag-web.pdf'>Pixel Imaging via Compressive Samplng</a> : A nice article on cameras/imaging and how people are using compressive sensing in the field.
* <a class = "link" href = 'https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/compressed-sensing-and-single-pixel-cameras'>Terry Tao's Blog Entry</a>
* <a class = "link" href = 'http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zlin/A%20Mathematical%20Introduction%20to%20Compressive%20Sensing.pdf'>A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing</a>: If you enjoy mathematical rigor in general, you might want to look at the first few chapters of the book. Most of the proofs I used were taken from this book.
* <a class = "link" href = 'https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/RIP.pdf'>Restricted Isometry Property and its Implications in Compressed Sensing</a>: This papers contains the proof of the error bound of the L<sub>1</sub> minimization solution based on the RIP property. 
* If you're still hungry for more resources, check out the <a class = "link" href = 'http://dsp.rice.edu/cs/'>Rice University Repository</a>.
