### Hi there, I'm Yash Sanghvi!
I'm currently employed as a project scientist at IIT Madras under the guidance of [Prof. Uday K.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/) I graduated from IIT Bombay with a dual degree in Electrical Engineering (B. Tech + M. Tech.) in 2018. 

Currently I am working on the inverse scattering problem, focussing on techniques for imaging strong scatterers. My research interests include **computational imaging**, **inverse problems**, **signal processing** and intersection of these fields with **compressed sensing** and **machine learning**.

You can find .pdf version of my CV [here]("/PhD_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf").
